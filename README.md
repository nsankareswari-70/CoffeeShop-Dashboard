### CoffeeShop-Dashboard
Project Overview:

To better understand customer purchase behavior and streamline operational efficiency, I collected transactional data from January to June 2023. The primary goal of this project is to transform the raw dataset into an interactive, dynamic dashboard that franchise owners can use to identify key patterns, trends, and opportunities for business growth.

Core Objectives

Profile and Prepare the Raw Data for Analysis
Conduct data cleaning, validation, and preprocessing to ensure accuracy and usability. This includes handling missing values, standardizing formats, and structuring the dataset for meaningful analysis.

Explore the Data Using Excel Pivot Tables
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to summarize sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends. Pivot tables are used to reveal relationships, identify anomalies, and establish the foundation for deeper insights.

Build a Dynamic Dashboard to Visualize Key Patterns and Trends
Develop a user-friendly, interactive dashboard that enables franchise owners to filter, drill down, and visualize sales trends, purchasing patterns, and operational insights to support data-driven decision making.
